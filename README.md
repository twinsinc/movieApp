# movie_app

A simple movie app built with TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Getting Started

The App has 2 Tabs: Movies and Search.

Functionality:

- movie search (type a title into the search bar in the search tab)
- adding movies to favourites (press on the heart button on the movie screen, in both tabs possible)
- hiding movies from future search (sviping a movie to the left to hide it, only search tab)
- alert in case of lost internet connection
- local storage (favourite and hidden movies persist on restart)
